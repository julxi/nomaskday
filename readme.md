A simple website I made that allowed my friends to place bets on the end date of the Corona pandemic.
It's no longer active, but I thought it was a fun little project to share.

If you want to run the frontend part, you can use the following command:
```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output gen/elm_live.js
```
Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` and click on the `index.html` file.
